    "## The minimal Python script\n",
    "Unlike many other languages, a simple Python script does not require any sort of header information in the code. So, we can look at the standard programming example, Hello World, in Python (below). Here we're simply printing to screen. If we put that single line into a blank file (called, say, HelloWorld.py]) and then run that in the command line by typing 'python HelloWorld.py' the script should run with no problems. This also shows off the first Python function, print, which can be used to print strings or numbers."

    "There are, however, a few lines that you will usually see in a Python script. The first line often starts with #! and is called the shebang. For a Python script, an example of the shebang line would be \"#!/usr/bin/env python\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Python, any line that starts with # is a comment, and won't be executed when running the script. The shebang, though, is there for the shell. If you run the script by calling python explicitly, then the script will be executed in Python. If, however, you want to make the script an executable (which can be run just by typing \"./HelloWorld.py\") then the shell won't know what language the script should be run in. This is the information included in the shebang line. You don't need it, in general, but it's a good habit to have in case you ever decide to run a script as an executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common thing at the starts of scripts is several lines that start with 'import'. These lines allow you to allow import individual functions or entire modules (files that contain multiple functions). These can be those you write yourself, or things like numpy, matplotlib, etc."

That means that variable types are entirely defined by what the variable is stored.\n",

If we'd like to store more dimensions, then we are using what are referred to as lists of lists. This is *not* the same thing as an array, which is what numpy will use. Let's take a look at what a list does.\n",

Feel free to try changing the operations that we're using and see what causes errors, and what causes unexpected results."
