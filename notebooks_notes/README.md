# Notebook Notes

This is folder, in which you can annotate the notebooks, run the code, etc.

Simply run the file "__nb_copy.sh__" followed by the week number to access the live 
version of the notebook of that week.

```bash
./np_copy.sh week_number
```

__Note__: The `__week_number__' must be followed by a `0' if  the week number is __below 10__.
